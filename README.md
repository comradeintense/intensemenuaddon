# Intense Menu Addon

### About

Intense Menu is an addon that I developed for myself to speed up the workflow in Blender when I'm doing asset creation for Cities Skylines. It incorporates some of the most used (for me) actions/shortctuts into one single place, in a nice menu accessible with hotkeys.

### Installation

To install the addon, first download it from here: https://github.com/comradeintense/intensemenuaddon/raw/main/intensemenu.zip and then save it anywhere you want on your local hard drive. You do not have to extract the archive, leave it as .zip file.

After that, in Blender go to Edit > Preferences > Addons (Left menu) and click on Install on the top menu. Locate the zip file and install.

Make sure you enable the addon by ticking the check mark.

Now the addon is ready to use, activating it by pressing the "**D**" key in either object mode/edit mode/uv editor area in the viewport.
